# Learning-Python   :   Web Scraping

    A repo of small programs I made while learning about Web Scraping with Python.

    "Local Scraping.py" is a program that scrapes a local html page named "Home.html" stored in the "HTML" folder.

    "main.py" is a program which scrapes data from "timesjobs.com" and filters the data based on posted date and skills and stores the information in a csv file "Jobs Posts.xlsx".
